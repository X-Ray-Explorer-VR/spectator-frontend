Spectator frontend is a web page created using Next.js that shows the interactions of the VR application including extra information of the scanned bones.

## Running the app using super container

If you want to run the web page and all the releated functionality we recommend use the Docker Compose file that you can find here: [X-Ray-Explorer-VR/super-container](https://github.com/X-Ray-Explorer-VR/super-container)

It contains all the needed dependencies, including a MariaDB instance and a copy of the database, to run all the project services (excluding the VR application).
